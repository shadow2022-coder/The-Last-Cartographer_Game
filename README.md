# The Last Cartographer

A browser-based, turn-based RPG game where you play as a cartographer navigating through a mysterious, fog-covered world. Map the unknown, battle corrupted creatures, and restore the lost reality.

Game Overview

The Last Cartographer is a solo, turn-based RPG that runs entirely in your web browser. Your character is one of the few who can see through a magical fog that has consumed the world. Your mission is to explore and map lost territories, find ancient treasures, and fight the creatures that now live in the fog.

Key Features

* *Grid-Based Exploration:* The game world is a 15x15 grid that you must navigate. As you move, the fog-of-war is lifted, revealing new areas.
* *Turn-Based Combat:* When you encounter an enemy, the game shifts to a strategic, turn-based combat system where you choose your actions.
* *Resource Management:* You must carefully manage your Health and your supply of Ink, which is needed for both mapping and special abilities.
* *Character Progression:* Gain experience by defeating enemies to level up your character and improve your stats.
* *Persistent Save System:* Your progress is automatically saved in your browser's storage, so you can close the game and pick up right where you left off.

How to Play

* *Movement:* Use the **WASD** or **Arrow Keys** to move. Each step consumes one Ink and reveals the surrounding area. Be careful not to run out of Ink.
* *Combat:* In combat, you have four choices:
    * *Attack:* Deal damage to the enemy.
    * *Defend:* Reduce the next incoming damage by half.
    * *Use Potion:* Restore a portion of your health.
    * *Use Skill:* A powerful attack that costs 10 Ink.
